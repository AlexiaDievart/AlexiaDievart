- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexiaDievart
- 👀 I’m interested in Marine Ecology, especially on what ecological consequences parasites can have on ecosystem-forming species such as mussels.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R to do my stats (still feeling like a cave woman).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on review papers, open sciences and a lot of other things.
- 📫 You can reach me directly on this app !
